#Flask-React-Todo

##Getting Started

This project is divided into two parts. A python app, built using Flask and MongoDB, which contains the API. The second part is a node app that is serving the web app built in React.

### API
To start the API server you'll need to install the required dependencies using ```pip install > requirements.txt``` by standing in the project root.

After the dependencies have been installed. Run ```python run.py``` to start the server. It runs on port 5000

### Web App
To start the Node App ```cd app/``` and run ```npm install``` to install the required dependences.

After that can use ```npm start``` to start the server on port 8001 and start waching the repository for changes to the React App. You will also be able to run the tests by running ```npm test```.
